# Image_classification_FashionMNIST
This project is the basic implementation of image classification. 

In this project is main source code that handles learning and saving model. Downloading FashionMNIST dataset.

Then there is models where you can find 3 basic models you can use. 

Last is Helper_function.py you can find original file on: https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning
But there are 2 new fuctions. For setup device and to plot multiple images right on top of the file. 

Best achieved Accuracy is 88%, but it was trained on only 3 epochs so...

Requirements are not included. But from import you can adapt. Using newest version possible on date 27.3.2023. (Pytorch still on 1.13. but souldn't be difference between 1.13 and 2.0)
